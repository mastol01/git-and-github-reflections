Repositories
  	Inside a repository, there is a .git folder. This is hidden using the period.
	You can see it using ls -a  (list files -all)
 
Creating a new Repository
	git init
	Using an existing directory with files in it or without.
	There are no commits when you create a git. You need to create the first "snapshot".

Review a git repository
	git status
	Shows all changes since the last commit
	Also shows you which branch you are in
	
The Staging Area
	git add <filename>
	File ready to be commited. Use git status to see which files are untracked, tracked.
	Staging Area - like a checkpoint for the files you want to commit
	Working Directory - Where you see files in current state
	Repository - shows all versions
